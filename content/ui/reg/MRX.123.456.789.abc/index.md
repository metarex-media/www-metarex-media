# MRX.123.456.789.abc

**Congratulations**.This is a sample url intended to show how a simple ID can
resolve to a web page where there is information on how to:

* check you've got the right page (`metarexId`)
* get a unique string that identifies the metarex type (`type`)
* and a set of useful keys to identify ways to enlighten the data. The
  specification and schema need to be developed during the project and Proofs of
  Concept, but potential values are:
  * `schema` links to one or more schema(s) for this metadata
  * `format` the `Content Type` for an HTTP header
  * `specification` url of a human (or machine) readable syntax & semantic
    definition
  * `decoder` links to one or more decoder(s) for the metadata
  * `encoder` links to one or more encoder(s) for the metadata
  * `services` links to online services that can handle the raw or metarex
    encapsulated metadata
