## Responsive Narrative Factory wins Best IBC Accelerator 2023

{{%  metarex %}} teamed up with [Infuse Video] to lead the **2023 IBC Accelerator Project - Responsive Narrative Factory**. 
Guided by our champions, the [BBC] and [theIET], we sought to deliver a hyper-personalised experience based on individual choices that was delivered by a metadata driven software pipeline.

* Don't like the Bunny in Big Buck Bunny - _that's fine_. 
* Don't like nature programs where baby birds get eaten - _that's fine too_.
* Only got 10 minutes to watch a 90 minute football match - _no worries_!

With the help of [Cuvo], [EZDRM], [JPBMedia] and the **IBC Accelerator Team** the [online demo] sparked joy with hundreds of visitors to the booth at the show.

We would like to thank the whole team that made this possible: 

* [Ruud van der Linden] and [Ismael Garrido] from [Infuse Video] who spent long hours wrestling with Content Delivery networks and sitting at the booth to make this a success.
*  `[Tristan Larke] at [MetaRex] who fought with all the metadata to make it all seem so simple.
* [Joshua Berger] for his support. 
* [Ian Wagdin] at the [BBC]
* [Russell Trafford-Jones] at the [Institution of Engineering and Technology (theIET)]
* [Olga Kornienko] at [EZDRM]
* [Mala Ramakrishnan], [Phani Kolaraja] and [Ganesh Sundaram] at [CuVo]. 

Also a warm thanks to [Mark  Smith] and [Muki Kulhan] at the [IBC] (International Broadcasting Convention) for their support, encouragment and enthusiasm for this project!
