# {{< metarex >}} at IBC 2023: Responsive Narrative Factory

The **Responsive Narrative Factory** [(RNF)] is an **IBC Accelerator** project that will be showcased at this year's IBC show between 15th - 18th September 2023 at the RAI centre, Amsterdam.

We're teaming up with [Infuse Video], the **BBC**, [CuVo] and others to show what can be achieved when you mix the following in a simple demonstration:

* seamless metadata handling
* IMF style component based media handling
* great content
* customer interaction
* IBC show guest [Responsive Narrative Factory] and **BBC**

Basically ultra-fine-grained-personalisation becomes a relatively simple
task if you have all the right components ready to go.

The Infuse video player uses metadata provided by {{< metarex >}} to deliver the
components of a programme that the viewer wants. No extra storage or redndering
is required - it's just a matter of using the metadata to automate the
preparation.

Technical, timeline and demonstration details will appear on our [RNF] page so
you can follow along and maybe even download the MetaRex code from our [Github Repo.]

The [Responsive Narrative Factory] will be showcased as an [IBC Accelerator] at
