Details of the mxf-live project can be found in this [blog] post. 
For further details of the release can be found in the {{< metarex >}}[Docs](https://metarex.media/docs/) section.

This specification was the impetus for starting the MetaRex project.  We hope to
repeat the demo on a larger scale with a more generic solution in 2024.
