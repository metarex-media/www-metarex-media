This brilliant, and cheeky character drawing was created by Anila, Sirine and Yasmin, who took part in the event, [Coding for Media].

**Coding for Media**, was hosted by [Eviden] for the [Next Tech Girls].    
Next Tech Girls run tech-focused events and work experience placements to encourage teenage girls in the future of technology and women in the industry.

The event was for a group of sixth formers to work in teams, solving and working through coding challenges, which were designed by {{< metarex >}} 

Not only was {{< metarex >}} involved with setting the coding challenge, but [Bruce Devlin] was also one of the speakers on the day, along with with representatives from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Women in Streaming Media.  

A special thank you, to Anila, Sirine and Yasmin for the drawing and well done to all the young ladies who took part in the event.
