<img class="ui centered bordered rounded image" src="/img/blog/sponthanks-2024-08-10.png" alt="Thank you sponsors">

Many thanks to our great sponsors, backers and partners. We couldn't do this
without you.

Over the next few weeks we'll be telling you about our sponsors, their metadata
products and services and how {{% metarex %}} fits into their world. You can
sign up to visit them and win a cuddly Rexy at IBC here:
[https://auth.metarex.media/ui/registration][th].

The instructions for our [IBC Treasure Hunt][th] are on the [treasure hunt][tr]
page of the website. The more of our partners you visit, the bigger the chance
of winning a cuddly rexy for your children, or your loved one, or yourself!

Follow {{% metarex %}} on [LinkedIn][li] to catch a glimpse of Rexy before the
show. She's shy and only appears in jigsaw form at the moment!
