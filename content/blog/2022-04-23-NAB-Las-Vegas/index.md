Intelligent Content was a key theme of the show and the {{% metarex %}} team wandered the show floor
expecting to find that all the problems had been solved by existing products and
services.

It came as a surprise to find that the world can fill 80% of the world's internet
traffic with streams of video and audio, but the metadata transport puzzle was
still a piecemeal region-by-region, application-by-application, device-by-device
tailored solution.

We proposed the {{% metarex %}} project to gauge interest Specifically we asked:

* Is transporting and preserving media metadata a problem?
* Would it help if there were a common `zip-like` solution for any metadata?
* Would it help if there were a common timing model independent of frame rate and sample rate and timezone?
* Would it help if you could download tools and apps from Github for free?
* Would you be prepared to contribute to a fund to make it happen?

The answer to all these questions was **Yes**. Time to start figuring out how to make it real...
