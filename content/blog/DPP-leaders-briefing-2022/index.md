The DPP Leaders briefing is one of the must-attend events of the year. A truly
international crowd with awesome speakers and a great 2 day narrative including
futurology, current challenges, diversity, equality, inclusivity, sustainability
and of course metadata.

I can't blog about what was said on the stage, but I can say that the importance
of metadata was agreed, by all. 
Chris and I asked the same questions that I
asked at [NAB](content/blog/NAB2022-Las-Vegas/index.md) and [IBC](content/blog/IBC-2022/index.md/) and the resounding **_yes!_** response confirmed that the {{% metarex %}} project continues to be needed. 

Looks like December and January are going to be busy...
