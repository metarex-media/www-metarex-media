The DPP Leaders briefing is one of the must-attend events of the year. A truly
international crowd with awesome speakers and a great 2 day narrative including
futurology, current challenges, diversity, equality, inclusivity, sustainability
and of course metadata.

I can't blog about what was said on the stage, but I can say that the importance
of metadata was agreed, by all. 
Chris and I asked the same questions that I
asked at [NAB](http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/04/23/metarex-at-nab-2022-in-las-vegas/) and [IBC](http://localhost:1313/blog/2022/09/18/ibc-show-2022/) and the resounding **_yes!_** response confirmed that the {{%
metarex %}} project continues to be needed. 

Looks like December and January are going to be busy...
