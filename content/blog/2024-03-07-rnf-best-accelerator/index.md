## Responsive Narrative Factory wins Best IBC Accelerator 2023

{{%  metarex %}} teamed up with Infuse Video to lead the 2023 IBC Accelerator
Project - Responsive Narrative Factory.
Guided by our champions, the [BBC] and [theIET], we sought to deliver a hyper-personalised experience based on individual choices that was delivered by a metadata driven software pipeline.

* Don't like the Bunny in Big Buck Bunny - _that's fine_. 
* Don't like nature programs where baby birds get eaten - _that's fine too_.
* Only got 10 minutes to watch a 90 minute football match - _no worries_!

With the help of [Cuvo], [EZDRM], [JPBMedia] and the **IBC Accelerator Team** the [online demo](/app/demos/demo12) sparked joy with hundreds of visitors to the booth at the
show.
