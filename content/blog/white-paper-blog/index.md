## {{< metarex >}} - one of the many ways that it can benefit you and your company

The [award winning][0], **{{< metarex >}} Project** makes metadata flow. 
The more metadata you have, the more you will benefit.  
But how?  Here are our top 10 reasons (there are plenty more!): 

1. {{< metarex >}} lets you define **_your own_** metadata.
2. {{< metarex >}} [defines a container][2] for your metadata.
3. {{< metarex >}} maps containers to many types of network so that you get metadata transport for _**<span class="ui purple text">free</span>**_!
4. {{< metarex >}} gives you a [unique ID][3] for your new **_type_** of metadata.
5. {{< metarex >}} lets you publish _services_ for your metadata _type_.
6. You can **_monetize_** those services.
7. {{< metarex >}} lets you discover _services_ for _unknown_ metadata types.
8. {{< metarex >}} supports **all** types of metadata including text & binary, timeline & static, frame locked, sample locked & stochastic, single stream & mixed streams of metadata.
9. {{< metarex >}} is built on standard tools, standard formats and standard frameworks.
10. {{< metarex >}} can run in a product, on-premise or globally.

**Bonus one** {{< metarex >}} is a _**<span class="ui purple text">free</span>**_
   [software framework][1]!

### But why is it useful?

Like most things, it comes down to money. Over the last 30 years we've figured
out how to move video and audio around at reasonable cost, but the metadata
always gets lost!

It's often faster and easier to invent your own metadata than it is to use
someone else's - often because there's not a good description of what the
metadata is. {{< metarex >}} makes those descriptions readily available and so
reduces the amount of engineering for metadata interchange and introduces a new monetization opportunity between metadata creators and consumers - _even if the two companies have never met_.

### Some examples

Here are some examples from the {{< metarex >}} Use Case :

<table class="ui celled definition table">
  <thead class="center aligned">
    <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Live<br>Production</th>
    <th>Virtual<br>Production</th>
    <th>Post<br>Production</th>
    <th>Distribution</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
  <tbody class="center aligned">
    <tr>
      <td>Application</td>
      <td>News</td>
      <td>On Set</td>
      <td>QC</td>
      <td>Localization</td>
      <td>Avails</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Common<br>Interchange<br>Formats</td>
      <td>NewsML<br>NinJS<br>arbitrary <code>.xls</code></td>
      <td>Cooke Lens<br>Arri Lens<br>Custom Telemetry</td>
      <td>qc.ebu.io<br>Venera xml<br>custom csv</td>
      <td>imf<br>ttml<br>webVTT</td>
      <td>Movielabs<br>custom json<br>custom csv</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Today, most systems in each of these segments have to convert between the
formats they are likely to see. Each format converter will have its own
eclectic mix of behaviors because the code for these convertors is often a
custom integration/plugin by the MAM or Playout or Editor vendor. This results
in lots of effort being wasted just to interchange metadata between systems in
a reliable format.

{{< fo t = "block"
   id    = "live"
>}}

### Transport makes things worse

For each and every data format of the metadata, there is often a custom
protocol or signalling mechanism to identify the metadata. You'll often find
that a simple piece of metadata will have different signalling in different
file formats or on different networks, despite the fact that **IT'S AN
IDENTICAL XML**.

If you're not familiar with this problem, just find an engineer who's
implemented an interoperable subtitling transport system, then buy them a drink
and ask _"Sounds like moving a few bytes per frame is pretty easy, isn't it?_" then sit back and enjoy the show for the next hour or two while they let off steam.

  <thead class="center aligned">
    <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>

      for ongoing version upgrades and support). 
      I've called this the (very rough) <em>Integration Factor</em> below and, yes, I've ignored volume of transactions.

### Compare with {{< metarex >}}

The {{< metarex >}} framework requires someone to register meta-meta-data that
allows a decoding device to say _Aha, there is NinJS in the MetaRex container_". It allows a network interface to say _"Aha, I know how to put MetaRex containers on my network"_.

The {{< metarex >}} framework also allows transformers to be registered that
can perform a canonical conversion from format A to format B (and possibly
charge for it), so if your application receives NewsML but needs NinJS then you can write your own or try a 3rd party one **_BEFORE YOU WRITE CODE_**.

The integration factor for {{< metarex >}} is simply the number of base formats & networks added together rather than being multiplied together and then multiplied by all the implementations.

<table class="ui celled definition table">
  <thead class="center aligned">
    <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Live<br>Production</th>
    <th>Virtual<br>Production</th>
    <th>Post<br>Production</th>
    <th>Distribution</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
  <tbody class="center aligned">
    <tr>
      <td>Application</td>
      <td>News</td>
      <td>On Set</td>
      <td>QC</td>
      <td>Localization</td>
      <td>Avails</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Today's<br>Workflows</td>
      <td><span class="ui header text">36</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui header text">36</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui header text">20</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui header text">30</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui header text">40</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tomorrow With<br>MetaRex</td>
      <td><span class="ui green header text">7</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui green header text">7</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui green header text">6</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui green header text">6</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
      <td><span class="ui green header text">7</span><span class="ui violet text"> rif</span></td>
    </tr>  </tbody>
</table>

I've tweaked the non-{{< metarex >}} number to compensate for the range
of products available in each segment.

What I've not included in the numbers is how {{< metarex >}} can give an almost GitHub-like robustness to versioning and updating metadata flow. That's for a future study.

### So who benefits from this?

**<span class="ui green header text">Everyone benefits!</span>**

{{< metarex >}} enables a generic metadata supply chain with the rigour that we are starting to develop with video and audio.

* **Content Creators** can now track and convert metadata from camera to screen
* **Product Vendors** can now integrate more metadata types for less initial
  and significantly less engineering costs
* **Data Warehousing** can benefit by integrating disparate timeline metadata
  with the same ease as static metadata
* **Metadata Producers** can benefit with greater access to more networks and
  file formats with no extra effort
* **Metadata Consumers** can benefit by simultaneously managing and using
  multiple transformed variants of source metadata without increasing costs
* **The Industry** can benefit by spending the money saved by {{< metarex >}}
  on creating rich, metadata driven workflows instead of just leaving the
  metadata on the floor
* **The planet** might benefit if we spent microWatts of energy remembering the source metadata rather than spending kiloWatts of energy guessing what was lost by using an AI algorithm
