Rexy recommends that you join the **[{{% param backer %}}][web]** now and
attend one of their awesome events to get the best insights and predictions for
this chaotic industry we find ourselves in.

The **[{{% param backer %}}][web]** is the media industry's international
community. Over 500 member companies get insight and connections that help them
to do business better. The DPP publishes leading industry analysis, and hosts
highly respected conferences in the USA, UK, and Europe. It also fosters
collaboration around technology and workflow projects, such as Live Production
Exchange (LPX). This project provides a framework for automating live
production workflows by enabling machine-to-machine communication to publish
and subscribe to live events.  Reuters ([5.A35]), Imagen ([5.A35]), and
Wolftech ([7.D34]) will all be showing LPX demos on their stands at IBC.

For more information and to see all the exciting things **[{{% param backer
%}}][web]** are working on, [have a beer with them at IBC][meet] and enjoy
the hospitality with [BT Media and Broadcast][booth].
