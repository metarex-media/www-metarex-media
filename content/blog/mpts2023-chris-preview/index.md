The **Media Production and Technology Show** takes place on the 10th & 11th of May, at [Olympia] in London. We're thrilled to be one of the exhibitors at booth **H.24** in this year's event

This leading industry event will bring together experts and innovators in production and media technology for two days. There is an impressive line-up of exhibitors and speakers, including our Executive Director Bruce Devlin.  He will be hosting a discussion on MetaRex with an [inspiring panel](https://www.mediaproductionshow.com/2023-seminar-programme/metarex-s-fedex-metadata-simplifies-workflows), including representatives from Garden Studios, Eluvio, Anna Valley and Mo-Sys

We also recently attended NAB, where Bruce and Katya spread the word about MetaRex and gained numerous new backers, including Signiant, SDVI, GrayMeta, and Metaglue, who are all investing to help realize our vision for seamlessly flowing Metadata and releasing its full potential.

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our Backers for your support.  Without you we couldn't do this MetaRex project. 

We hope to see you at the **Media Production and Technology Show**!
