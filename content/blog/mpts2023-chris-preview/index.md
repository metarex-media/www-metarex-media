We also recently attended NAB, where Bruce and Katya spread the word about MetaRex and gained numerous new backers, including Signiant, SDVI, GrayMeta, and Metaglue, who are all investing to help realize our vision for seamlessly flowing Metadata and releasing its full potential.

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our Backers for your support.  Without you we couldn't do this MetaRex project. 

We hope to see you at the **Media Production and Technology Show**!
