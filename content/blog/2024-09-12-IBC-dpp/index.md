The **[{{% param backer %}}][web]** is hosting their legendary **Espresso
Summit** tomorrow morning. It's a member only event, so if you're not a **[{{%
param backer %}}][web]** member already, then you've missed it. Rexy recommends
that you join now and attend one of their awesome events to get the best
insights and predictions for this chaotic industry we find ourselves in.

The DPP is the media industry's international community. Over 500 member
companies get insight and connections that help them to do business better. The
DPP publishes leading industry analysis, and hosts highly respected conferences
in the USA, UK, and Europe. It also fosters collaboration around technology and
workflow projects, such as Live Production Exchange (LPX). This project
provides a framework for automating live production workflows by enabling
machine-to-machine communication to publish and subscribe to live
events.  Reuters ([5.A35]), Imagen ([5.A35]), and Wolftech ([7.D34]) will all
be showing LPX demos on their stands at IBC.

For more information and to see all the exciting things **[{{% param backer
%}}][web]** are working on, [have a beer with them at IBC][meet] and enjoy
the hospitality with [BT Media and Broadcast][booth].
