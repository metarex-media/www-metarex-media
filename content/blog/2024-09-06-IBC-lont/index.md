**[{{% param backer %}}][web]** offers a platform that combines video
production with real-time personalization at scale. We help B2B enterprises
efficiently create, update, and deliver personalized video content by blending
traditional video workflows with Generative AI elements. Our solution allows
businesses to produce multiple, customized versions of video content with
minimal manual effort, seamlessly integrating into existing workflows. While
this approach is gaining traction in B2B, we believe it will also shape the
future of media and entertainment in the coming years.

**[{{% param backer %}}][web]** on MetaRex: _"It was amazing to work with Bruce
and the MetaRex team to win the IBC Accelerator 2024 Media Innovation Award!
What they are building will be instrumental in creating efficient, low-friction
workflows that deliver customized and personalized content to viewers without
overly complicating the production process."_

**[{{% param backer %}}][web]**'s CEO, Ruud van der Linden, will be at IBC and
still has some availability for meetings. [DM him to schedule a time][meet].
