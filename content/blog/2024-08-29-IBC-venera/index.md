**[{{% param backer %}}][web]** is one of our wonderful backers and we couldn’t
be successful without them. If you sign up to Rexy's fun **[IBC treasure
hunt][ths]** then you'll have a chance of ***winning a cuddly Rexy!*** The more
partners and backers you visit, the greater chance you'll win on Sunday
afternoon in the IBC [AI Zone][rxydraw]. Sign up at
[https://auth.metarex.media/ui/registration][ths]. Instructions on the [treasure hunt
page][thp].

Follow {{% metarex %}} on [LinkedIn][limrx] to catch a glimpse of Rexy before
the show. She’s shy and only appears in jigsaw form at the moment!

**[Venera][web]** brings trust and reliability to automated QC workflows. Their
relentless drive to make sophisticated software understandable, usable and,
above all trustworthy for your business. The huge volumes of metadata their
products create sometimes hides the fact that they work tirelessly behind the
scenes to improve standards and workflows that allow true interoperability
between different systems. You can see concrete examples of this via their
support of the [EBU QC project][ebuqc].

**[Venera][web]** will introduce at IBC **[QCtudio][qc]** (pronounced ‘Q
Studio’) - the perfect companion to their flagship cloud-native Quasar® QC
solution. With its intuitive, interactive interface, **[QCtudio][qc]**™
simplifies the review of the Quasar QC reports by visualizing audio and video
alerts on a timeline alongside a media proxy. Truly the perfect blend of
software acceleration of human judgement.

**[Book a meeting][meet]** with Venera at #IBC2024 this year using
this [link][meet] and you can also visit them in [Hall 7, Stand #D45][7.D45].
