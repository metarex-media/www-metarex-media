**[Venera][web]** brings trust and reliability to automated QC workflows. Their
relentless drive to make sophisticated software understandable, usable and,
above all trustworthy for your business. The huge volumes of metadata their
products create sometimes hides the fact that they work tirelessly behind the
scenes to improve standards and workflows that allow true interoperability
between different systems.

**[Venera][web]** will introduce at IBC **QCtudio** (pronounced ‘Q Studio’) -
the perfect companion to their flagship cloud-native Quasar® QC solution. With
its intuitive, interactive interface, **QCtudio**™ simplifies the review of the
Quasar QC reports by visualizing audio and video alerts on a timeline alongside
a media proxy. Truly the perfect blend of software acceleration of human
judgement.

**[Book a meeting][meet]** with Venera at #IBC2024 this year using
