Intelligent Content was a key theme of the show and the {{< metarex >}} team wandered the show floor expecting to find that all the problems had been solved by existing products and services.

It came as a surprise to find that the world can fill 80% of the world's internet traffic with streams of video and audio, but the metadata transport puzzle was still a piecemeal region-by-region, application-by-application, device-by-device tailored solution.

{{< fo t = "block"
  id    = "block2"

We proposed the {{< metarex >}} project to gauge interest Specifically we asked:

* Is transporting and preserving media metadata a problem?
* Would it help if there were a common `zip-like` solution for any metadata?
* Would it help if there were a common timing model independent of frame rate and sample rate and timezone?
* Would it help if you could download tools and apps from Github for free?
* Would you be prepared to contribute to a fund to make it happen?

{{< fo t = "block"
  id    = "block3"
  src   = "/img/dino/mrx-logo.svg"
  srcOn = "left"
  alt = "metarex logo"
>}}
The answer to all these questions was **_Yes_**, then time to start figuring out how to make it real...
