Here are some of the key objectives for the {{%  metarex %}} Project:

{{< fo t = "block"
  id    = "summary"
>}}
🦖   MetaRex has a _**free**_ software framework! 

🦖   MetaRex lets you define **_your own_** metadata.

🦖   MetaRex [defines a container][2] for your metadata.

🦖   MetaRex maps containers to many types of network so that you get metadata transport for _**free**_!

🦖   MetaRex gives you a [unique ID][3] for your new **_type_** of metadata.

🦖   MetaRex lets you publish _**services**_ for your metadata _**type**_.  You can monetize those services.

🦖   MetaRex lets you discover _**services**_ for unknown metadata types.
 
🦖   MetaRex supports **all** types of metadata including text and binary, timeline and static, frame locked, sample locked & stochastic, single stream and mixed streams of metadata.

🦖   MetaRex is built on standard tools, standard formats and standard frameworks.

🦖   MetaRex can run in a product, on-premise or globally.
