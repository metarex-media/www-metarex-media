**[{{% param backer %}}][web]** is one of our wonderful Backers and we couldn’t be successful without their support and having them work with us in the ***MetaRex Treasure Hunt*** at IBC 2024.

Follow {{< metarex >}} on [LinkedIn][limrx] to catch a glimpse of Rexy before the show!

**[Venera][web]** brings trust and reliability to automated QC workflows. Their relentless drive to make sophisticated software understandable, usable and, above all trustworthy for your business. The huge volumes of metadata their products create sometimes hides the fact that they work tirelessly behind the scenes to improve standards and workflows that allow true interoperability between different systems. You can see concrete examples of this via their support of the [EBU QC project][ebuqc].

**[Venera][web]** will introduce at IBC **[QCtudio][qc]** (pronounced ‘Q
Studio’) - the perfect companion to their flagship cloud-native Quasar® QC
solution. With its intuitive, interactive interface, **[QCtudio][qc]**™
simplifies the review of the Quasar QC reports by visualizing audio and video alerts on a timeline alongside a media proxy. Truly the perfect blend of software acceleration of human judgement.

**[Book a meeting][meet]** with Venera at #IBC2024 this year.  You can also visit them in [Hall 7, Stand #D45][7.D45].
