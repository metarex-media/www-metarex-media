## {{% metarex %}} on the set

The [award winning][0], philanthropic, non-profit {{%  metarex %}} project
makes metadata flow. In the rapidly changing world of On Set Virtual Production
we already have too many incompatible formats and protocols and the poor
setup and data wrangling crew perform miracles on every shoot do get things
stable and keep them stable until it's time for tear down.

Play the video on the left to hear the views from the [SMPTE RIS OSVP][1]
experts on the debate between Standards & Products. We believe, like many
of the points raised in the video, that products will lead the way and standards
will eventually follow.

### But why is {{% metarex %}} useful?

Our {{% metarex %}} initiative is just plumbing to help the product innovators
concentrate on great story telling products, confident that the metadata they
rely upon will get to where it's needed quickly, accurately and in a way that
can be transformed easily depending on the use-case they haven't imagined yet.

The {{% metarex %}} container wraps up _**any**_  metadata and then the
container is put on a network or storage system. We now have one, unified, free
mechanism for handling _any_ metadata. This allows single way to get a clear
definition of **what** the metadata is, what **version** of the metadata was
used, what is its **specification**, can it be automatically **QC**'d with a
**schema** and are there any **services** available to be sure it's right
before it's too late?

As the SMPTE Rapid Industry Solutions On Set Virtual Production project enters
its publication phase and we start to see harmonized metadata schemas and new
protocols appearing, there will be a need to manage the transition to this new
world. {{% metarex %}} aims to provide the plumbing to allow multiple variants
of the same metadata values to be managed on a single network without insanity
taking over.

### We Need You!

We'll be showing {{% metarex %}} use-case examples for Virtual Production at
NAB. You'll be able to play with the examples online - even if you're not at
the show.

Most importantly - we need you! We need more [backers][b] to get the project
over the finish line. Ideally we'd like 2 more **<span class="ui violet
text">silver</span>** [backers][b] or 15 more **<span class="ui brown
text">regular</span>** [backers][b] so that we can finish this phase of
delivering our [free software][f] and make it production ready for you to use.

### So who benefits? <span class="ui red text">Everyone Benefits!</span>

{{% metarex %}} enables a generic metadata supply chain with the rigour that we
are starting to develop with video and audio.

* **Content Creators** can now track and convert metadata from camera to screen
* **Product Vendors** can now integrate more metadata types for less initial
  and significantly less engineering costs
* **Data Warehousing** can benefit by integrating disparate timeline metadata
  with the same ease as static metadata
* **Metadata Producers** can benefit with greater access to more networks and
  file formats with no extra effort
* **Metadata Consumers** can benefit by simultaneously managing and using
  multiple transformed variants of source metadata without increasing costs
* **The Industry** can benefit by spending the money saved by {{% metarex %}}
  on creating rich, metadata driven workflows instead of just leaving the
  metadata on the floor
* **The planet** might benefit if we spent microWatts of energy remembering the
  source metadata rather than spending kiloWatts of energy guessing what was
  lost by using an AI algorithm

The {{% metarex %}} project needs **you!** Please become a [backer][b] - We're
offering a 10% discount until April 30th 2024. We will happily shout your
company's name across the globe if you can help us get the project over the
finish line.

Don't forget to come and see us at NAB 2024 on the [Signiant][s] booth
[W.1931][n]
