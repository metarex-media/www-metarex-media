## History of Rexy

The first drafts of Rexy was created in early 2021 by Amber Bardell.  At the time she was just a logo for {{% metarex %}} but since then Rexy has grown as a character with her own personality and backstory, had various artwork and vidoes made of her adventures and even been made into a soft toy!
