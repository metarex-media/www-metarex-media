## _Rexy's Backstory_ by Amber Bardell

Rexy is a spirited young T-Rex with a keen sense of adventure. She explores new habitats with her trusty companion Egg, the Egret. But where did she come from and how did Rexy and Egret meet?

Let’s journey back to the very beginning....

Once upon a time, Rexy was just an egg nestled in her mother’s warm nest, surrounded by many siblings. However, fate had different plans. 
Despite the watchful eyes of the elder dinosaurs in the community, Rexy’s egg managed to slip away and roll out of the nest. Even just days before hatching, Rexy exhibited a remarkable sense of adventure—perhaps she was destined for a unique journey unlike that of her siblings.

As the egg rolled through shallow waters, grassy pastures, and rocky ravines, it finally came to a stop in a serene clearing at the edge of a lush rainforest. It made quite the entrance, catching the attention of a curious pair of egrets. It didn’t take long for Rexy to be nestled alongside a much smaller companion egg. The egrets had kindly taken in a dinosaur egg and Rexy and Egg hatched within hours of each other. That was where the seeds were planted for their unlikely friendship, but unfortunately it wasn’t plain sailing from there. 

Following their instincts, the egret parents soon moved away, fearing Rexy’s size and species. They needed to raise their young in safety. Left to wander on her own, Rexy didn’t know that Egg would soon rejoin her. She sought shelter under palm trees, navigating a mostly tranquil world where she found the odd campfire to sleep by or fashioned a leaf umbrella for shade. Though she initially struggled to adjust to the varied climates, she remained resilient.

Egg, on a search for their own adventure, quickly found Rexy. Whilst initially a bit of a nuisance, Egg quickly became Rexy’s best friend. Their contrasting strengths formed a strong team and an almost symbiotic bond. Now Egg, a silent, eagle-eyed scout, soars above while Rexy bounds below. It isn’t uncommon for Egg to snack on the bugs he finds on Rexy’s back. Together, they find all kinds of mischief—running through forests, evading erupting volcanoes, or fishing for their dinner—always returning to their trusty metadata centers in one piece.

Nowadays Rexy's natural aggression is channeled into protecting her metadata, her intuitive right, as she seldom encounters other dinosaurs or predators in her quiet world. Perhaps she’s the last of her kind? As she roams, she always searches for good homes to store her precious metadata, with the right conditions to keep them safe and sound.
