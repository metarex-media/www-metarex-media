## Why the dinosaur?

The {{% metarex %}} logo (the dinosaur) was created by [Amber Bardell][AB].

The original concept of our logo was to symbolize how the media tech
industry uses metadata – ***like a dinosaur driving a steam train*** - it mostly
doesn't happen!.

With [Amber’s][AB] fabulous creativity, Rexy (the dinosaur) was born in 2021.
Working together, [Amber][SZ] and [Simi Zeko][SZ], created the first rendering
video of Rexy which was released in March 2021.

<div class = "ui olive container segment">
  <video class = "ui image" autoplay = "1" loop = "1" controls = "1" muted = "1">
    <source src = "/meeja/mrx3-roar.mp4">
  </video>
</div>

Rexy is such a wonderful character and now has her own backstory, personality,
and character development, which will be serialized here. Please [subscribe to

### Why is Rexy driving a steam train?

Not only having a dinosaur (Rexy) shows how the industry treats metadata, to
have her driving a steam train also represents the way the media and tech
industry uses metadata – slow and old-fashion.
