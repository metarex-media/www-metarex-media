## Why the dinosaur?

The {{% metarex %}} logo (the dinosaur) was created by Amber Bardell.

The original concept of our logo was to symbolize how the media tech
industry uses metadata – ***like a dinosaur driving a steam train*** - it mostly
doesn't happen!

With Amber’s fabulous creativity, Rexy (the dinosaur) was born in 2021.
Working together, Amber and Simi Zeko, created the first rendering
video of Rexy which was released in March 2021.

<div class = "ui olive container segment">
  <video class = "ui image" autoplay = "1" loop = "1" controls = "1" muted = "1">
    <source src = "/meeja/mrx3-roar.mp4">
  </video>
</div>

### Why is Rexy driving a steam train?

<div class = "ui centered fluid image"><img src = "/img/dino/mrx-train-long-1000.png" alt = "rexy"></div>

Not only having a dinosaur to show how the industry treats metadata, to have her driving a steam train also represents the way the media and tech industry uses metadata – slow and old-fashion.
