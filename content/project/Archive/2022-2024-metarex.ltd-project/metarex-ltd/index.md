{{< metarex >}} was created for the following reasons:


{{< metarex >}} is an initiative dedicated to developing an open-source framework for the transport of media metadata. This framework will allow you to preserve, transport, identify, and use metadata from many sources in a single workflow. This will make it easier to manage metadata and ensure that it is accurate and consistent whenever video content is processed, broadcast, or distributed.

1. Raise funds to create the {{< metarex >}} Open Source Software
2. Maintain a board until end 2024
3. Maintain a website to run the project & communicate results
4. Publish the workplan to build the Software
5. Distribute funds to project grant applicants (companies & individuals)
6. Dissolve itself after 2 years at the boards discretion

### Board

A board of 3-7 members is initially created from the Gold Tier backers. The
company health is led by the Executive Director and the work is coordinated
by the Gold & Silver Tier backers.

### Work Plan

The work plan is managed in working groups that comprise small, targetted work
packages that result in:

1. Open Source Code including SDK, apps, schemas, encoding, registration & processing.
1. Open Source Hardware Definitions.
1. Public Domain Data (for testing, registration, operational use).
1. Specification documents - machine readable where possible.
1. A free to access register for public projects

### Timeframe

The initial backers, company incorpration, board and draft work plan will be in
place by 2022-12-31. First grant applications & proposals can be received
against the work plan 2023-01-01. Gantt Chart on the
[Project]({{< relref "/project" >}} "project")

The project will continue until 2024-12-31 and then be wound up by the board

ensure it's longevity.
