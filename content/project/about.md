{{% metarex %}} is an initiative dedicated to developing an open-source framework for the transport of media metadata. This framework will allow you to preserve, transport, identify, and use metadata from many sources in a single workflow. This will make it easier to preserve production and post-production metadata than it is to lose it or leave it behind.


### A (very) brief history of MetaRex

The {{% metarex %}} project started back in 2022. We had a small board of members which initially create the Gold Teir Backers and led the structure and health of the company. 
At the end of 2024, the board was dissolved. 

The project was completely funded by Backers.  We had three tiers, **Gold, Sliver and Regular** and each tier contributed towards to MetaRex project. 

Below is the list of Backers.  Without their support we would not of been able to get to were we are today - thank you! 

You can view our [GitHub] account to see what we achieved.
