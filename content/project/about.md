----------

{{< metarex >}} is dedicated to developing an open-source framework for the transport of media metadata.  This framework will allow you to preserve, transport, identify, and use metadata from many sources in a single workflow. This will make it easier to preserve production and post-production metadata than it is to lose it or leave it behind.

### How does MetaRex work?

Itâ€™s super easy to send anything by FedEx - even a baby dinosaur! ðŸ¦– 
You just put your stuff in a box (or letter) and they slap two labels on it with a barcode, then send it off. 

With {{< metarex >}} it is very similar process, except no physical box or letter!

1. **The Destination** - send to MetaRex HQ 
2. **The Manifest** - a barcode that points to a database.  Magic happens and the box travels over train networks, air networks, couriers, bicycles and just gets to where you want it to.
