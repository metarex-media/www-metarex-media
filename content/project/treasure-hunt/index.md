Rexy has grown up! No longer a toddler, she has become a young teenager with
some attitude and we have a cuddly rexy to give away.

Join us at IBC 2024, RAI, Amsterdam for a MetaRex Treasure Hunt with help from
our Sponsors and Backers!

Visit booths at IBC with a special Rexy QR code which will be near metadata
demonstrations. Scan the QR code, complete the Treasure Hunt and your name will
be put in the pot for a lucky dip and the chance to win a handmade Rexy toy on
Sunday afternoon!
