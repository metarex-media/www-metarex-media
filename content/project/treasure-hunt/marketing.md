Hope you are well.

As we have mentioned previously, we would like to do a MetaRex Treasure Hunt at
this year’s IBC and would love your help.

The idea will be to have a QR code hidden somewhere on your booth which people
will have to find. When people scan the QR code, we will link information about
(your company) and MetaRex, and how we are working together.

Please let us know if there’s a particular webpage from your website which you
would like us to link to and encourage people to visit. Once someone has
scanned all the QR codes from the various booths, their name will be put into
the pot and on the last day of IBC, someone will be picked at random and will
receive a handmade dinosaur soft toy.

The aim of this is that it will help increase the footfall to your booths, as
well as a fun way of introducing MetaRex to people.

Either Bruce or I will send you the QR details once they have been finalised
and some dinosaur stickers which can be given out to people on the booth.

Let us know your thoughts and if there is anything you need from us. Thank you
so much for your support!

Best wishes, Charlotte
