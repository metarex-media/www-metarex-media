## Backer Agreement

You can download a sample of the current backer agreement. If you become a
backer, then a signable version will be sent to you along with your invoice.

## Samples

Sample files are continually updated during the project. Typically the versions
on the various GitHub repos will be less reliable that the older, published
versions here.
