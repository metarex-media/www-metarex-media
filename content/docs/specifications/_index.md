### The {{< metarex >}} Envelope

Start by reading the [MRX envelope introduction][01] that leads you through the
container design choices amongst the many containers available. From that
point, you can read the detailed spec of the [MRX container][02] in its
work-in-progress status. There may be further detailed discussions in the
metarex [GitHub][03] repository's [issues][03] section.

There's also the easy-access [White Paper blog from 2024][04].

### The {{< metarex >}} Register

The register converts a `metarexId` e.g. [MRX.123.456.789.reg][id] into a set
of links where you can find information and services related to that metadata
type.

The specification for the JSON that is returned from a [register query][12]
has the `metarexId` [MRX.123.456.789.reg][id]. You can use the [web app][10]
to browse the register or to add your own content (registration required) or
you can inspect the register using the API [here][11].


### The {{< metarex >}} Register API

The register API is generated from an [OpenAPI 3.0 document][d1] that can be
[viewed as an online document][d2].
