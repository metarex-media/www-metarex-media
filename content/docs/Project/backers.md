The project is being funded by backers who want to see a body of Open Source
code appear in the industry. Backers may be product vendors, integrators,
production companies, Billion Dollar multi-nationals or Contract Programmers
working from home. The goal is to get a large number of people to make small
donations to help get the software written,

* **80%** of funds raised will be given away as grants
* **20%** of funds raised will be used to run the project

Backers make two donations - one in calendar year 2023 and one in 2024. The
more we raise, the more software we can commission. The numbers below are the
minimum for each backer tier.
