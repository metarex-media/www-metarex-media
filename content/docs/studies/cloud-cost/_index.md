#### We're proposing a simple paradigm

* A minimal, cloud-independent model of the major cloud cost points
  * e.g. EC2 type
  * NAT Gateway boundaries for traffic
  * storage types
  * dB
* A normalization tool to import real-time pricing data to the model
* A normalization tool to import real-time energy mix data to the model
* A `middleware` approach to integrate [`opentelemetry.io`](https://opentelemetry.io)
* A [grafana-friendly](https://grafana.com/) output format

We are looking for supporters to turn this into a real Proof Of Concept in
two phases:

1. Q3/Q4 2025 - optimise the {{%metarex%}} worker and build a normalizer for
   AWS to be demonstrated at IBC 2025.
2. Q1/Q2 Deploying the test system in a real environment and improve the model.

We estimate about 10 weeks of engineering for each phase and are looking for
collaborators who might find 1 or more weeks of engineering @ £1000/wk.
