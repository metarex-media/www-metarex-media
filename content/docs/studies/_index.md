We want the metadata experience for users to be a good one. In our concept
diagram, you can see that video and audio generally flow well with
today's media tools. The metadata, however, is usually subject to failure.
This is <span class = "ui red text">bad</span>!

   srcClass = "ui centered image"
   alt = "MetaRex Concept"
   text = "MetaRex Concept - we want metadata to flow"
   header = "Figure"
/%}}

{{< metarex >}} allows metadata to flow in a wide variety of situations. Below

we're looking for sponsors to tailor the free software to your precise needs.
