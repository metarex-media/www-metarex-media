## What is {{< metarex >}}?

Metarex is an initiative dedicated to developing an open-source framework for
the transport of media metadata. This framework will allow you to preserve,
transport, identify, and use metadata from many sources in a single workflow.
This will make it easier to manage metadata and ensure that it is accurate and
consistent whenever video content is processed, broadcast, or distributed.

## Why is {{< metarex >}} needed?

There is currently no standard way to transport media metadata. The lack of
transport medium can cause these metadata issues:

1. It is lost or corrupted during the production process
2. Incompatibility with different software applications
3. Difficulties in managing and searching

## How will {{< metarex >}} help improve metadata management?

{{< metarex >}} will create a **standardised** way to transport metadata,
ensuring that metadata is always transported in the same way, regardless of the
software application used. This will make it easier to manage and search
metadata, and it will also reduce the risk of metadata being lost or corrupted.

{{< metarex >}} will make metadata **interoperable**, which means that it will
be compatible with different software applications. This will make it easier to
share metadata between different systems, and it will also make it easier to
access metadata from different sources.

{{< metarex >}} will be **extensible**, meaning new metadata formats can be
easily added to the framework. This will ensure that {{< metarex >}} can support
the latest metadata standards, and it will also make it easier to add new
metadata fields to the framework.

## Who is behind the {{< metarex >}} project and how is it funded?

The {{< metarex >}} team is led by renowned media technologist [Bruce Devlin],
who has had a significant impact on the way that media is produced and
distributed. Devlin is a former head of standards for SMPTE and a member of the
EBU. He is passionate about open-source solutions and is committed to making the
media industry more accessible and efficient. {{< metarex >}} is a
not-for-profit initiative and is funded by donations from companies that will
benefit from free-flowing metadata.

## How will {{< metarex >}} benefit me?

We can help you streamline your workflows and connect you with our growing
network of companies. Your involvement will give you the opportunity to adapt
the Metarex framework to your requirements and allow you to be first to market.
