{{% metarex %}} is like Fedex for metadata.

* **Sender**
  * The Sender wraps their metadata in a standardized container.
  * A label is applied to identify the contents
  * The mapper puts the container on a transport: NDI, ST 2110, email, FTP etc.
* **Receiver**
  * The receiver takes the containers from the transport
  * The unwrapper reads the label to handle the data as clocked / unclocked,
    text / binary
  * The unwrapper extracts the metadata and may use a web service to do something
    automatic with the data e.g. make an overlay / transcode to the receiver's
    preferred format.
  * The end user now has access to, potentially, several variants of the metadata
    before they write their first line of code.
