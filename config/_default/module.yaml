# this theme is  migrating away from bootstrap towards a full fomantic site
# with simplified shortcuts that are created with partials to reduce custom code.

# CLI upgrade to the latest theme:   hugo mod get github.com/mrmxf/fohuw@main

# uncomment line below for temporary local development of module
# replacements: "github.com/mrmxf/fohuw -> ../../fohuw"
